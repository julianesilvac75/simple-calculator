# Simple Calculator

A simple JavaScript calculator with keyboard support.

This was a group project made as an assignment for the Brainnest Frontend Training program, and it was build with the contribution of my amazin group collegues: [Fernando](https://github.com/ferchoeth) and [Victor](https://github.com/BlckTitan).
